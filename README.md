# LinSecure - All in One Linux Security Baseline

A simple security baseline that compiles some of my security tools into an easy setup script to harden key parts of linux systems such as the UFW, file, user, and group permissions, VPN connections, the SSH Server, and HTTPS configuration for Apache2 web servers.

## Getting Started

To begin setup, run ``` sudo ./secure.sh ``` and follow all instructions in the installer. It's that easy!

## Built With

* Ubuntu - Debian Linux OS
* Kali Linux - Pentesting OS developed by Offensive Security
* Apache2 - Easy-to-use package for hosting websites
* OpenSSL - Package for encrpyting communications over computer networks
* SQLite3 - Relational Database Management System 
* SSH - Cryptographic Network Protocol for Operating Remote Machines
* [ProtonVPN](<https://protonvpn.com/>) - FREE VPN Service
* GitHub - This Website!
